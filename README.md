# Doctor search app in rails 

This is the mod2 project for my study in flatiron bootcamp, it is a joint project with Rachel. It was the sequel to the What's up doc Micky and I did in mod2.

It is a rails app both frontend and backend, linked to a mysql database. 

Main strength of this app include: 
* 12 data modules, including a complicated list module
* Advanced data linkage and logics
* Advanced search function
* semantic UI

To run,
1. start mysql server on localhost in terminal with: 
mysql.server start

2. inside the project folder: 
bundle install
rails s

3. In a browser, go to http://localhost:3000/studies and login


It was a pleasure working with Rachel. Eric our instructor and Greg our SEC helped us in many places. I am grateful for the chance to work with these great people.
