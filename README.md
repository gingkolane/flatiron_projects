# flatiron_projects

These are student projects I did with partners in the first three modules in flatiron bootcamp:

Mod 1: Ad Hoc Doc, with Miles and Wei
Mod 2: What's up Doc, with Micky
Mod 22: Doc search, with Rachel
Mod 3: Completion survey, individual project

Each project is added as a subtree of the original repository, then the original project deleted. 

It is great experiences working on these first projects in my life. Enjoyed working with different partners, and learned a lot from everyone.
