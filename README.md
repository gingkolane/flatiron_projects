# flatiron_projects

These are student projects I did with partners in the first three modules in flatiron bootcamp:

Mod 1: Ad Hoc Doc, with Miles and Wei<br/>
Mod 2: What's up Doc, with Micky<br/>
Mod 22: Doc search, with Rachel<br/>
Mod 3: Completion survey, individual project<br/>

Each project is added as a subproject of the master project repository,including the subproject's entire history. Subproject can run within its own subdirectory. 

 The original subproject repos are deleted, but can be splitted using "git subtree split". See ref:
 https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt

It is great experiences working on these first projects in my life. Enjoyed working with different partners, and learned a lot from everyone.
