<h2>Completion_survey</h2>

This is the mod3 project for my study. It was the first version of the issue-reporter-for-learnco, to add a student survey to the learn.co labs to help debugging issues in the lab. 

It was built was rails API and vanillar javascript, linked to a local postgreSQL database

To run, 
1. start postgreSQL server on localhost
2. go to /completion-api, rails s to start the server
3. open index.html from a browser

Graham helped me to define the scope and watched my progress throughout this project. I am grateful for his help.
